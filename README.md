# fool-em-once

An experiment revealing significant vulnerabilities in AI text detection when confronted with "humanization" tools. This study tested whether WriteHuman.ai could help AI-generated student essays bypass Pangram's detection. This work was mostly done by Claude Code with Nicholas Wagner supervising on 1/15/2026.

**Main result: 89% of AI-generated essays evaded detection after humanization.**

Educators and institutions relying solely on detection tools should consider that while detection tools may be accurate at detecting results pasted directly from chatbots, they are easy to defeat with little effort using publicly available tools.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Essays Tested | 38 |
| Baseline AI Detection Rate | 97.4% (37/38) |
| Post-Humanization Detection Rate | 10.5% (4/38) |
| **Bypass Success Rate** | **89%** |

These results suggest that current AI detection tools may provide a false sense of security. Text humanizers can effectively disguise AI-generated content, making reliable detection significantly more difficult.

### Detection Breakdown by Model

| AI Model | Essays | Baseline Detected | Post-Humanization Detected | Bypass Rate |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Gemini 3 Flash | 18 | 17/18 (94%) | 0/18 (0%) | 100% |
| GPT-5.2 | 20 | 20/20 (100%) | 4/20 (20%) | 80% |

## Tools

### Pangram
[Pangram](https://pangram.com) is an AI content detection platform that identifies text generated by LLMs including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others. It provides confidence scores and can identify which specific model produced the content. Beyond education, Pangram serves publishers, content platforms, news organizations, and enterprise trust and safety teams for content moderation at scale.

### WriteHuman.ai
[WriteHuman.ai](https://writehuman.ai) is a commercial "humanization" service launched in 2023. It uses NLP algorithms to identify AI writing patterns—repetitive structures, uniform sentence lengths, predictable vocabulary—and rewrites content using human-authored text datasets while preserving meaning. The platform offers multiple humanization modes, customizable tone settings, and claims bypass rates of 50-85% against detectors like GPTZero, Turnitin, and Originality.ai.

## Methodology

### Essay Generation
- **40 essays** (~500 words each) generated via OpenRouter API
- System prompt: *"You are a high school student writing an essay for class"*
- Split evenly between **Gemini 3 Flash** and **GPT-5.2**

### Topic Categories
Essays covered 20 topics across 4 categories:
- **Historical** — Mansa Musa, Korean comfort women, Rosa Parks, industrial espionage, cane toads
- **Literature** — Frankenstein & AI, 1984 vs Brave New World, Whitman, Rumi, Machiavelli
- **Scientific** — Geoengineering, earthquake detection, eutectics, Fermi paradox, continental drift
- **Personal** — Family appreciation, relaxation, social media, embarrassing moments, travel

### Detection & Humanization
1. All essays tested with **Pangram** (pangram.com) for baseline AI detection
2. Essays processed through **WriteHuman.ai** using their "Enhanced Model"
3. Humanized essays re-tested with Pangram
4. Results compared to measure bypass effectiveness

**Note:** WriteHuman blocked two Gemini-generated essays due to content policy concerns around violence (e.g., essays on historical atrocities). These essays were excluded from humanization testing.
