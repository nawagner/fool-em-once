When we talk about the richest person ever, most people immediately think of guys like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. It makes sense because their net worths are constantly in the news and are usually hundreds of billions of dollars. But if you actually look back through history, those guys might not even make the top five. Determining who was truly the richest is actually really hard because money worked differently hundreds of years ago, but most historians agree that the title belongs to Mansa Musa.

Mansa Musa was the ruler of the Mali Empire in West Africa during the 14th century. To understand why he was so rich, you have to look at what his empire controlled. At the time, Mali was basically the world’s biggest producer of gold. They also controlled the salt trade, which was a huge deal back then because salt was used to preserve food. Basically, he owned the supply of the two most valuable things in the world at that time.

The most famous story about his wealth is from when he went on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324. He didn't just travel with a few people; he took a caravan of tens of thousands of soldiers, heralds, and slaves, all dressed in expensive silk. He also brought dozens of camels, each carrying hundreds of pounds of gold. The story goes that he gave away so much gold to the poor in Cairo that he actually caused massive inflation and ruined the local economy for over a decade. Imagine being so rich that your tips literally crash a country's entire currency.

Of course, there are other contenders. Some people argue for Augustus Caesar, who ruled the Roman Empire. Historians say his personal wealth was equivalent to about 20% of the entire empire’s economy. Then there’s John D. Rockefeller from American history. His wealth was around $400 billion if you adjust it for inflation today. But the reason Mansa Musa usually wins this debate is that his wealth was "indescribable." There wasn't really a way to calculate it because he basically owned all the resources of his land outright.

The reason it’s hard to compare Mansa Musa to Elon Musk is because of "purchasing power" and how we value things. Today, billionaires have their wealth in stocks and apps. Back then, it was physical gold and land. Also, Mansa Musa was a king, so the line between his personal bank account and the country’s treasury didn't really exist.

In conclusion, while we see huge numbers on the Forbes list today, they don't really compare to the absolute power and gold that Mansa Musa had. He wasn't just a rich guy; he was the source of the world's gold. Even with all our technology today, no one has been able to match the kind of legendary wealth he displayed during his trip across Africa. He’s definitely the richest person in history.
