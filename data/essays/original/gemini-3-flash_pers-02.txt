I feel like everyone is always in a huge rush. My friends are always stressed about their SAT scores or trying to build some crazy resume for college, but honestly, I’m just not built like that. People call me "chill," which I guess is just a nice way of saying I don't really have a sense of urgency. But if I’m being real, my version of a perfect day isn't about doing something big or productive. It’s about the small stuff that actually makes life feel good.

My perfect day would start pretty late. I’m definitely not an early bird. I’d wake up when the sun is actually up and go straight to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. I’m not a coffee guy—it makes me too jittery, and I like staying at a level five out of ten energy-wise. I’d probably go with Earl Grey or maybe something herbal if I’m feeling extra relaxed. Then, I’d just sit on the couch with a book for a solid two hours. I’m currently into sci-fi, and there’s something so nice about being completely sucked into another world while the house is still quiet.

Eventually, I’d have to leave the house, but only for something fun. I’d meet up with my friends for lunch at this taco place near my neighborhood. We aren't the type of group that needs to go on some big adventure; we’re perfectly happy just sitting in a booth for way too long, eating chips and salsa and talking about nothing. That’s the best part about being chill—you don’t need a plan. You just hang out and see where the conversation goes.

After lunch, we’d probably head back to someone’s house to play video games. I’m not really into those super competitive shooters where everyone is screaming into their headsets. I much prefer co-op games like *Stardew Valley* or *Overcooked*. There’s something hilarious about failing a level together and just laughing it off instead of getting mad. It’s just about the vibes, not the high score.

By the time the sun starts going down, I’d be back home. The finale of my perfect day is definitely the "rot on the couch" phase. I’d turn on a show I’ve probably already seen three times—like *The Office* or some random documentary—and my cat, Mochi, would immediately come over. He’s basically the animal version of me. He just wants to sit there, be warm, and not be bothered. Having him purring next to me while I’m wrapped in a blanket is basically peak existence.

I know some people might think this sounds boring, but to me, it’s everything. Life is already loud and stressful enough at school. If I can spend twenty-four hours just being quiet, hanging with my favorite people, and petting my cat, I’d say that’s a pretty successful day. I don’t need to climb a mountain to feel like I did something important. Sometimes, just being relaxed is enough.
