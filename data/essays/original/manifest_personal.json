    "content": "Growing up, my kitchen was a battleground of smells. On one side, there was my dad\u2019s side of the family\u2014the German-American half. That meant mashed potatoes, pot roast, and maybe some sauerkraut if we were feeling adventurous. It was \u201cnormal\u201d food. It smelled like butter and salt. Then there was my mom\u2019s side. She moved here from Malaysia when she was in her twenties, and her cooking smelled like everything at once: pungent shrimp paste, sharp ginger, and spicy sambal that made me sneeze the second I walked through the door.\n\nTo be honest, for a long time, I hated it.\n\nI remember this one time in middle school when my mom packed me laksa in a thermos for lunch. When I opened it in the cafeteria, this thick, coconut-curry scent drifted out. It wasn't bad, but it was *loud*. My friend Tyler made a face and asked, \u201cWhat is that? It smells like old fish.\u201d I felt my face get hot. I shoved the lid back on and told him it was just some weird soup my mom made. I didn't eat the rest of the day.\n\nAfter that, I started asking for Uncrustables and chips. I wanted to be the kid with the brown paper bag that didn't draw any attention. I started feeling ashamed of how my mom would spend hours pounding spices in a mortar and pestle. I\u2019d see her hands stained yellow from turmeric and just think about how much easier it would be if we just had spaghetti like everyone else. I was trying so hard to lean into my \"American\" side that I was basically pushing my mom\u2019s culture out the door.\n\nEverything changed during my sophomore year when my grandma (my Ma Ma) came to visit from Malaysia. She didn't speak much English, but she spoke through food. One afternoon, she decided to teach me how to make Hainanese chicken rice. I tried to make an excuse to go to my room, but she grabbed my wrist and handed me a head of garlic.\n\nAs we worked, she showed me how the rice isn't just rice\u2014it\u2019s toasted in ginger and chicken fat until it glows. She told me stories (with my mom translating) about how this was the ultimate comfort food back home. When we finally sat down to eat, I didn't just taste the salt or the spice. I tasted the effort. I realized that while I was busy being embarrassed, my mom and grandma were literally pouring their history into these bowls.\n\nI started looking at my mom\u2019s cooking differently after that. I realized that her \"weird\" ingredients weren't something to hide; they were her way of staying connected to a home she left thousands of miles away. Now, when I walk into the house and smell that sharp scent of shrimp paste, I don't cringe. I actually get hungry. \n\nI\u2019m still half German-American, and I still love a good burger. But I\u2019ve stopped trying to be \"normal.\" Now, I\u2019m the kid who brings leftovers to school and doesn't care if the cafeteria smells like curry. If someone asks what it is, I don\u2019t say \"weird soup.\" I tell them it\u2019s my mom\u2019s specialty, and honestly, they\u2019re missing out.",

    "content": "I feel like everyone is always in a huge rush. My friends are always stressed about their SAT scores or trying to build some crazy resume for college, but honestly, I\u2019m just not built like that. People call me \"chill,\" which I guess is just a nice way of saying I don't really have a sense of urgency. But if I\u2019m being real, my version of a perfect day isn't about doing something big or productive. It\u2019s about the small stuff that actually makes life feel good.\n\nMy perfect day would start pretty late. I\u2019m definitely not an early bird. I\u2019d wake up when the sun is actually up and go straight to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. I\u2019m not a coffee guy\u2014it makes me too jittery, and I like staying at a level five out of ten energy-wise. I\u2019d probably go with Earl Grey or maybe something herbal if I\u2019m feeling extra relaxed. Then, I\u2019d just sit on the couch with a book for a solid two hours. I\u2019m currently into sci-fi, and there\u2019s something so nice about being completely sucked into another world while the house is still quiet.\n\nEventually, I\u2019d have to leave the house, but only for something fun. I\u2019d meet up with my friends for lunch at this taco place near my neighborhood. We aren't the type of group that needs to go on some big adventure; we\u2019re perfectly happy just sitting in a booth for way too long, eating chips and salsa and talking about nothing. That\u2019s the best part about being chill\u2014you don\u2019t need a plan. You just hang out and see where the conversation goes.\n\nAfter lunch, we\u2019d probably head back to someone\u2019s house to play video games. I\u2019m not really into those super competitive shooters where everyone is screaming into their headsets. I much prefer co-op games like *Stardew Valley* or *Overcooked*. There\u2019s something hilarious about failing a level together and just laughing it off instead of getting mad. It\u2019s just about the vibes, not the high score.\n\nBy the time the sun starts going down, I\u2019d be back home. The finale of my perfect day is definitely the \"rot on the couch\" phase. I\u2019d turn on a show I\u2019ve probably already seen three times\u2014like *The Office* or some random documentary\u2014and my cat, Mochi, would immediately come over. He\u2019s basically the animal version of me. He just wants to sit there, be warm, and not be bothered. Having him purring next to me while I\u2019m wrapped in a blanket is basically peak existence.\n\nI know some people might think this sounds boring, but to me, it\u2019s everything. Life is already loud and stressful enough at school. If I can spend twenty-four hours just being quiet, hanging with my favorite people, and petting my cat, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty successful day. I don\u2019t need to climb a mountain to feel like I did something important. Sometimes, just being relaxed is enough.",

    "content": "I feel like I spend half my life looking at a screen, and honestly, it\u2019s kind of exhausting. Social media is one of those things where I can\u2019t really imagine my life without it, but sometimes I really wish I could. It\u2019s like this weird love-hate relationship that everyone my age just accepts as normal.\n\nOn one hand, it\u2019s how I actually stay in the loop. If I wasn\u2019t on Instagram or TikTok, I feel like I\u2019d literally be a ghost. It\u2019s how my friends and I send each other dumb memes at 11 p.m. to show we\u2019re thinking of each other, and it\u2019s how I see what my cousins in Florida are doing without having to have an awkward twenty-minute phone call. During the pandemic, it was basically a lifeline. It makes the world feel smaller and more connected, which is supposed to be a good thing.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the downside, which feels like it\u2019s getting worse the older I get. My attention span is basically nonexistent now. I\u2019ll sit down to do my history homework, tell myself I\u2019m just going to check one notification, and suddenly forty-five minutes have passed. I\u2019ve watched thirty videos of people making pasta or organizing their closets, and I haven't even written the first sentence of my essay. It\u2019s like my brain is rewired to only focus on things that are fifteen seconds long. I try to read a book for English class and I find myself reaching for my phone every two pages just out of habit. It\u2019s actually kind of scary how much control the \"scroll\" has over me.\n\nThe worst part, though, is the \"highlight reel\" effect. I know, logically, that nobody\u2019s life is perfect. I know people use filters and only post when they\u2019re at a cool party or on vacation. But when I\u2019m sitting in my room in my pajamas feeling bored, and I see someone from school posting these amazing, aesthetic photos at a beach or out with a huge group of friends, I still get that sting of jealousy. It makes me feel like I\u2019m failing at being a teenager. You start comparing your \"behind the scenes\" to everyone else\u2019s polished front page. It makes everything feel like a competition that I didn't even sign up for.\n\nI\u2019ve tried deleting the apps before, but I usually last about two days. I end up feeling left out of the jokes or I miss a plan someone made in a group chat. It\u2019s like you\u2019re forced to participate if you want a social life, but the price you pay is your focus and your self-esteem. I guess I\u2019m just trying to find a balance, but it\u2019s hard when the apps are literally designed to keep you hooked. For now, I\u2019m just trying to be more aware of it\u2014maybe I\u2019ll put my phone in the other room while I finish this essay. Or at least I\u2019ll try.",

    "category": "personal",
    "model": "gemini-3-flash",
    "content": "So, looking back at it now, my interview for Northwood Prep was probably the most mortifying thirty minutes of my entire life. At the time, I honestly thought my future was over. I had spent weeks practicing \"professional\" answers in the mirror, wearing a tie that was way too tight, and trying to sound like a forty-year-old businessman instead of a fourteen-year-old who still liked playing video games.\n\nThe disaster started about two minutes in. I was so nervous that my hands were shaking, and when the admissions officer, Mr. Henderson, offered me a glass of water, I managed to knock the entire thing over. It didn't just spill; it launched across his desk, soaking his stack of brochures and dripping onto his very expensive-looking rug. I froze. My face felt like it was literally on fire. Instead of saying something cool or collected, I blurts out, \"Well, I guess I\u2019m making a splash,\" and then immediately wanted to crawl into a hole and die.\n\nMr. Henderson didn't laugh. He just stared at the puddle.\n\nFor the next ten minutes, I was a total wreck. I kept forgetting the \"perfect\" answers I had memorized. When he asked me about my favorite book, I blanked so hard I couldn't even remember the title of *The Great Gatsby*, which I had literally finished the night before. I ended up rambling about a comic book I read in middle school. I felt like a complete fraud. I wasn't the \"distinguished scholar\" I was trying to be; I was just a clumsy kid who couldn't even hold a cup of water.\n\nBut then, something weird happened. Since I figured I had already failed, I stopped trying to be perfect. I took a deep breath and just said, \"I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m incredibly nervous because I actually really want to go here, and I\u2019m currently doing a terrible job of showing you why.\"\n\nMr. Henderson actually smiled for the first time. He told me to relax and asked why I was so stressed. I ended up talking to him\u2014not like an interviewer, but like a person. I told him about how I struggle with being a perfectionist and how I was terrified of making a mistake. We talked about how being \"genuine\" is actually harder than being \"perfect.\"\n\nI walked out of that room sure I wouldn't get in, but a few weeks later, I got the acceptance letter. Mr. Henderson had actually written a little note on the bottom that said he appreciated my \"honesty under pressure.\"\n\nThat whole embarrassing experience taught me that being a \"perfect\" candidate isn't really the point. If I had just sat there and recited memorized lines, he wouldn't have known who I actually was. Spilling that water was the best thing that could have happened because it forced me to show how I handle a mess\u2014literally. It showed me that growth doesn't come from getting everything right the first time; it comes from being able to laugh at yourself, clean up the water, and keep talking anyway.",

    "content": "Last summer was honestly the worst time of my life. My parents finally got their divorce finalized after two years of constant fighting, and it felt like my entire world just kind of collapsed. I felt like I didn't even know who I was anymore because so much of my identity was tied up in being the \"peacekeeper\" at home. I was exhausted, sad, and just totally numb. So, when my mom suggested we take a trip to Bali just the two of us to \"reset,\" I wasn't really sure it would help, but I knew I needed to get away from my house.\n\nThe second we landed in Denpasar, it was like a total sensory overload. The air was so humid it felt like a blanket, and it smelled like incense and tropical flowers. We stayed in this small place in Ubud that was surrounded by rice paddies. For the first few days, I honestly just slept. I think my body was finally realizing it didn't have to be on high alert for an argument anymore.\n\nOne morning, we went to the Tirta Empul temple for a purification ritual. I\u2019m not really a religious person, but standing in the cold spring water with a bunch of strangers felt weirdly powerful. As the water hit my head, I kept thinking about all the stress of the last year\u2014the yelling, the moving boxes, the awkward silence at dinner. I realized I had been carrying all that weight around like it was my job to fix it. Letting go of that feeling was the first step in finding myself again.\n\nWhat really changed things for me, though, was just the pace of life there. In high school, everything is so fast and everyone is always trying to be someone they aren\u2019t. In Bali, people seemed so present. I started spending my afternoons just walking around or sitting in cafes without my phone. I started drawing again, which is something I totally gave up when things got bad at home. I realized that the \"authentic\" me wasn't the sad kid in the middle of a divorce; I was someone who liked art, spicy food, and being quiet.\n\nI also did a lot of thinking about my parents. I used to think the divorce meant our family was a failure, but being in such a beautiful, peaceful place helped me see it differently. It was just a change. Like the seasons or the tides. I started to feel like I could breathe again without feeling guilty about it.\n\nBy the time we had to leave, I didn't feel like a completely different person, but I felt like I had my \"spark\" back. Healing from trauma isn't like a movie where everything is fixed in one trip, but Bali gave me the space to remember who I was before everything broke. I learned that even when your world falls apart, you can still build something new and maybe even better. I\u2019m back at school now, and things are still hard sometimes, but I try to keep a little bit of that Bali peace with me.",

    "content": "When I was younger, I used to think my lunchbox was like a flashing sign that said, \u201cNot from here.\u201d I\u2019m half Chinese and half German-American, but the part that felt the loudest at school was my mom being a Malaysian immigrant. She speaks English with this careful, slightly musical accent, and she cooks like she\u2019s still living in the humid streets of Kuala Lumpur, even though we\u2019re in a bland suburban neighborhood where people think pepper is \u201cspicy.\u201d\n\nIn elementary school, my mom packed me food that actually had a smell. Not just a smell\u2014like, a presence. There would be fried rice with bits of egg and green onion, or leftover curry that had soaked into the rice overnight. Sometimes it was sambal on the side, this bright red chili paste that looked like it could melt plastic. I would crack my lunch open and instantly feel my stomach drop. Kids would lean over and say stuff like, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d or \u201cEw, it stinks.\u201d They weren\u2019t even always trying to be mean. They just didn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t want to be the person who had to explain.\n\nSo I started asking my mom for \u201cnormal\u201d lunches. I said it like it was a simple request, like asking for a different color shirt. \u201cCan you just make me a sandwich? Like turkey?\u201d She would pause for a second, and I could tell she didn\u2019t totally get it, but she tried. She bought sliced bread and deli meat, and she packed it with chips like the other moms did. I acted relieved, but honestly it tasted like nothing. The sandwich would be kind of soggy by lunchtime, and I\u2019d still feel weird, like I had traded something real for something that only looked right.\n\nAt home, though, I still ate my mom\u2019s food. I\u2019d stand in the kitchen while she cooked, watching her move fast without measuring, like her hands already knew. She would talk to me while stirring a pot, and sometimes she\u2019d switch between English and Mandarin without even noticing. My dad\u2014who\u2019s German-American and likes things \u201csimple\u201d\u2014would still go back for seconds. That always confused me. If he wasn\u2019t embarrassed, why was I?\n\nThe turning point wasn\u2019t one big moment. It was more like a bunch of small ones that added up. In middle school I started going to friends\u2019 houses and realizing their dinners were kind of\u2026sad. Like plain chicken breast and steamed broccoli every night. No hate, but it felt like food that was trying not to bother anyone. Around the same time, I started paying attention to how my mom lit up when she talked about her childhood. She\u2019d describe night markets and hawker stalls and how her mom taught her to make certain dishes. I realized her cooking wasn\u2019t just food. It was memory. It was survival. It was how she carried her whole life across an ocean.\n\nOne day in high school, we had this \u201cheritage potluck\u201d thing. I almost didn\u2019t bring anything, but my mom insisted on making nasi lemak. The night before, our kitchen smelled like coconut milk and pandan and toasted peanuts. I remember thinking, This is going to be so embarrassing. But when I put it on the table at school, people actually lined up. A girl in my history class said, \u201cWait, this is amazing\u2014what is it?\u201d And for once, I didn\u2019t shrink. I told her the name, and I told her my mom made it, and I felt proud saying it.\n\nNow I still cringe sometimes when my mom is loudly bargaining at the Asian grocery store or when she packs my little brother something that smells \u201ctoo strong.\u201d But I catch myself defending it. I even crave it. When I\u2019m stressed, the idea of her soup feels like being understood without talking. I think I was ashamed because I wanted to disappear into everyone else\u2019s idea of \u201c",

    "content": "People call me \u201cchill,\u201d and I guess that\u2019s true. I\u2019m not the type who needs to have every second planned or be doing something \u201cproductive\u201d all the time. Honestly, my perfect day is kind of simple, but it\u2019s the kind of simple that makes me feel like my brain finally unclenches. If I could design a day exactly how I want it, it would start slow and stay cozy all the way through.\n\nI\u2019d wake up without an alarm blaring at me like I\u2019m in an emergency situation. The first thing I\u2019d do is make a cup of tea. Not in a fancy way either, just the normal routine: kettle on, mug out, pick a tea bag based on vibes. There\u2019s something calming about the whole process, like it tells my body, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sprint today.\u201d I like sitting there while it steeps, watching the steam rise, and feeling my hands warm up around the mug. It\u2019s such a small thing, but it sets the tone.\n\nThen I\u2019d grab a book and read for a while. I\u2019m not always good at reading when school is busy, because my mind keeps trying to jump ahead to whatever I\u2019m stressed about. But on a perfect day, I can actually sink into the story. I like when the house is quiet and I can hear the pages turning, and I don\u2019t have to check my phone every five minutes. I\u2019m not trying to speed-run the book, either. I just want to be in it for a bit, like a break from real life.\n\nBy late morning or early afternoon, I\u2019d meet up with friends for lunch. Nothing too fancy\u2014just a place where we can talk and not feel rushed. I love that part of the day because it\u2019s like the social version of comfort. We\u2019d probably talk about dumb stuff, like a random video we saw, or something that happened in class, or what game we\u2019re all stuck on. There\u2019s something really nice about laughing in public and not caring if we\u2019re a little loud.\n\nAfter lunch, the ideal plan is co-op video games. I\u2019m not super competitive, so co-op is perfect because it feels like you\u2019re on the same team instead of trying to destroy each other. I like when we\u2019re all working together and it gets chaotic in a funny way. Like someone accidentally presses the wrong button and everything goes wrong, and instead of getting mad we just laugh and try again. It\u2019s honestly one of my favorite ways to hang out, because we\u2019re doing something together but there\u2019s no pressure to be \u201cdeep\u201d the whole time.\n\nAnd then the night part of my perfect day is just watching TV next to my cat. My cat always acts like he doesn\u2019t care about anyone, but the second I sit down, he suddenly needs to be there. He\u2019ll curl up beside me and act like he owns the couch, and I\u2019ll put on some comfort show I\u2019ve already seen. I like that feeling of winding down when nothing is expected of me anymore.\n\nThat\u2019s my perfect day: tea, pages, friends, games, and a cat-shaped blanket. It\u2019s not dramatic or exciting, but it feels like me. And honestly, that\u2019s enough.",

    "content": "I didn\u2019t get social media because I thought it would change my life or anything. At first it was just a way to keep up with people. In middle school especially, it felt like if you weren\u2019t on Instagram or Snapchat, you were basically invisible. Everyone would be laughing about something from a story, or planning stuff in a group chat, and if you weren\u2019t there you\u2019d find out later and feel kind of left out. So I downloaded the apps and told myself it would just be for \u201cchecking in\u201d with friends.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes it really does connect me. I like seeing my cousins\u2019 posts because they live in a different state and I don\u2019t get to see them much. My grandma has Facebook and she comments on everything like \u201cLove this!\u201d with a million exclamation points. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing but also sweet, because it means she\u2019s paying attention. When one of my friends moved away last year, social media was how we stayed close. We\u2019d send videos back and forth and keep each other updated on random stuff like a teacher being annoying or a new song we found. In those moments, social media feels like a bridge. It makes the distance smaller.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the other side, which I try not to ignore because it\u2019s the part that messes with me. I\u2019ll open TikTok to watch one video and suddenly forty minutes are gone. It\u2019s not even like I\u2019m enjoying it the whole time. It\u2019s more like my brain goes on autopilot and I\u2019m just scrolling because the next thing might be interesting. Sometimes I\u2019ll put my phone down and feel sort of gross and restless, like I ate too much candy. I notice my attention span getting worse too. I\u2019ll start homework and immediately want to check my phone \u201cfor a second.\u201d Or I\u2019ll try to watch a movie with my family and I can\u2019t stop thinking about what I\u2019m missing online, which is dumb because it\u2019s usually nothing important.\n\nThe jealousy part is what I hate admitting. I know people don\u2019t post their worst moments. Nobody\u2019s posting themselves crying in the bathroom or failing a test. People post the best angle, the best lighting, the highlight reel. I understand that logically. But emotionally, it still gets to me. I\u2019ll see someone\u2019s perfect vacation photos or a group of friends at a party and I\u2019ll suddenly feel like I\u2019m doing life wrong. Like everyone else is constantly having fun and looking amazing and I\u2019m just\u2026not. Even when I know it\u2019s curated, it\u2019s hard not to compare. Sometimes it\u2019s not even about looks. It\u2019s about seeing people hang out without you, or watching someone else get attention, and it makes you question your own place in your friend group.\n\nWhat\u2019s complicated is that I don\u2019t want to quit completely. When I take breaks, I feel calmer, but I also feel disconnected. It\u2019s like social media is both the party and the noise outside the door. Lately I\u2019ve been trying to set little boundaries, like leaving my phone in another room while I do homework, or turning off notifications for certain apps. I\u2019m not perfect at it, but I\u2019m noticing that I feel more like myself when I\u2019m not constantly watching everyone else.\n\nI think social media isn\u2019t totally good or totally bad, which is annoying because I wish it was simpler. It helps me stay close to people I care about, but it also steals my focus and makes me compare my behind-the-scenes to someone else\u2019s best moments. I\u2019m still figuring out how to use it without letting it use me.",

In real life, I was a sweaty fourteen-year-old wearing a blazer that felt like a costume, sitting in the car outside the school and trying to remember if I was supposed to make eye contact for exactly three seconds or if that was a myth from the internet.\n\nThe campus was quiet in that way rich schools are quiet, like even the trees have good manners. My mom fixed my collar in the parking lot like I was five. I walked in and the lady at the front desk smiled and told me to take a seat. Everything smelled like lemon cleaner and old books. I tried to sit in a confident way, but the chair squeaked loudly and somehow it made me feel like I already failed.\n\nThen the admissions guy came out and said my name. I stood up too fast, my folder slid out of my hands, and my papers went everywhere like confetti. Instead of just laughing and picking them up like a normal person, I panicked and blurted, \u201cThis is not how I usually am.\u201d Which, honestly, was a lie. I\u2019m exactly like that sometimes.\n\nHe helped me gather everything and led me into his office. There were framed photos on the walls and a little bowl of candy on his desk. He asked me basic questions like why I wanted to go there, what I liked to do, and what my favorite class was. All normal stuff. Except my brain decided to abandon me. I answered one question by saying, \u201cI enjoy\u2026 reading and also\u2026 teamwork.\u201d Like those were two hobbies you do on weekends.\n\nAt one point he asked what book I was currently reading, and I tried to sound impressive, but my mind went blank. The only title I could think of was *Diary of a Wimpy Kid* because my little brother had left it on the couch. So I said that. Then, for some reason, I tried to recover by adding, \u201cBut like, in an ironic way.\u201d That made it worse. He raised his eyebrows a little, and I felt my face get hot. I started talking faster, and I knocked over the water bottle they\u2019d given me. It rolled off the desk and water spilled on the carpet. I apologized about fifty times. He handed me paper towels like this happened every day, which somehow made me feel even more embarrassed.\n\nWhen the interview ended, I walked out feeling like I\u2019d just watched myself in third person doing every wrong thing possible. In the car, I told my mom, \u201cI ruined it.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop replaying it in my head. I was sure the admissions guy was writing notes like \u201cclumsy,\u201d \u201cawkward,\u201d and \u201cpossibly raised by wolves.\u201d\n\nBut a weird thing happened after I got home. Once I got over wanting to crawl into my bed forever, I realized the interview was the first time I couldn\u2019t hide behind being \u201cthe smart kid\u201d or \u201cthe responsible one.\u201d I was just me, messy and nervous and trying. And honestly, that\u2019s real. I wrote a thank-you email where I admitted I was nervous and thanked him for being kind about it. I didn\u2019t make excuses. I just owned it.\n\nWhether I got in or not, that interview taught me something important: being impressive isn\u2019t the same as being genuine. I learned that I can mess up in a big, public way and still keep going. I can be embarrassed and survive it. And if a school wants students who are perfect all the time, then maybe it wasn\u2019t the right place anyway. But if it wants people who can learn, adjust, and laugh at themselves later, then I guess that interview",

    "content": "The year my parents divorced, everything in my life started to feel like it was made out of thin glass. Nothing was technically \u201cbroken\u201d at school or with my friends, but I felt like I could shatter at any second. At home, the air felt heavier. Even normal stuff\u2014like making dinner or doing laundry\u2014had this weird sadness stuck to it. I didn\u2019t know what to do with all the anger and confusion, so I did what I\u2019m good at: I tried to act fine. I kept my grades up, answered \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d when people asked, and scrolled on my phone late at night until I couldn\u2019t think anymore.\n\nWhen my mom suggested a trip to Bali that summer, I didn\u2019t get it at first. Going somewhere pretty didn\u2019t seem like it could fix anything. It almost felt wrong, like we didn\u2019t deserve a vacation when our family had just fallen apart. But she said she needed to breathe, and honestly, I did too. So we went.\n\nThe first thing I noticed in Bali was how loud the world was in a different way. Not loud like arguing. Loud like scooters buzzing, birds yelling in the morning, and the ocean making this steady sound that didn\u2019t change depending on anyone\u2019s mood. At home, it always felt like I was listening for the next problem. In Bali, I started listening to things that weren\u2019t about my parents at all. That alone felt like a break.\n\nOne day we took a walk through rice terraces early in the morning. The sun made everything look unreal, like someone turned the brightness up. I remember thinking, \u201cThe world is still here.\u201d That sounds obvious, but it wasn\u2019t to me. After the divorce, it felt like my world had ended, so seeing people just living\u2014farmers working, kids laughing, tourists sweating and complaining\u2014was a reminder that life doesn\u2019t stop. It keeps moving, even if you don\u2019t feel ready.\n\nI also did something I didn\u2019t expect: I cried in public. We were at a temple, and there were offerings everywhere, these small baskets with flowers and incense. It was quiet, and the smell was kind of sweet and smoky. I don\u2019t know why, but I suddenly felt all the feelings I\u2019d been holding in. Not just sadness, but embarrassment, and disappointment, and this deep tiredness from pretending. I cried without trying to hide it, and no one acted like it was a huge deal. My mom didn\u2019t tell me to stop. She just stood next to me. That moment didn\u2019t erase the trauma, but it made it feel less like a secret shame and more like something I could actually survive.\n\nOver the week, I started noticing small parts of myself coming back. I laughed more. I took photos not to post, but because I genuinely wanted to remember. I wore a swimsuit without obsessing over how I looked. I tried new foods and didn\u2019t panic about being \u201cweird\u201d or doing it wrong. It was like I remembered I had a personality outside of being someone\u2019s kid in the middle of a messy breakup.\n\nWhen we flew home, our problems weren\u2019t magically solved. The divorce was still real, and it still hurt. But Bali gave me space to feel things without drowning in them. It showed me that healing isn\u2019t one big moment where everything becomes okay. It\u2019s more like waking up and choosing, little by little, to live as yourself again\u2014even if your family doesn\u2019t look the way you thought it would.",
