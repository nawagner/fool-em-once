Have you ever looked at a map of the world and noticed how South America and Africa look like two puzzle pieces that should be stuck together? I remember noticing that in elementary school, but I didn't realize there was actually a huge scientific theory behind it. This idea is called continental drift, and it was first really pushed by a guy named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s. He argued that all the continents used to be one giant "supercontinent" called Pangea. Even though people thought he was crazy at first, we now have a ton of evidence that proves he was right.

The first and most obvious piece of evidence is the "jigsaw fit" I mentioned. If you look at the coastline of western Africa and the eastern coast of South America, they line up almost perfectly. It’s not just those two, either; if you move the continents around on a map, you can see how North America, Europe, and Greenland all kind of nestle together. Scientists have even used computers to show that if you look at the continental shelves (the underwater edges) instead of just the shorelines, the fit is even better because sea levels have changed over time.

Another really cool piece of evidence is fossils. Scientists have found fossils of the exact same plants and animals on continents that are now separated by thousands of miles of ocean. For example, there’s a prehistoric freshwater reptile called the Mesosaurus. Its fossils are found in both South America and Africa. Since it was a freshwater animal, there is no way it could have swum across the salty Atlantic Ocean. The only logical explanation is that the two continents were touching when the Mesosaurus was alive. There’s also a plant called Glossopteris that has been found in Australia, Antarctica, India, Africa, and South America. Since seeds for that plant were too heavy to be blown by the wind across oceans, the land had to be connected.

We also have geological evidence, like rocks and mountain ranges. If you "reconnect" the continents, you can see that the Appalachian Mountains in the U.S. actually line up with the Scottish Highlands and mountains in Scandinavia. They are made of the exact same type of rock and are the same age. It’s like someone took a long mountain range and snapped it into pieces, then moved the pieces away from each other.

Finally, there’s evidence from paleoclimatology, which is the study of ancient climates. Scientists have found scratches on rocks in places like India and Africa that were caused by glaciers. These places are super hot today, so it wouldn't make sense for glaciers to be there unless those continents were much closer to the South Pole millions of years ago.

Even though Alfred Wegener died before he could prove *how* the continents moved, we now know about plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. All these clues—the shapes, the fossils, the rocks, and the ice—make it pretty clear that our world used to look way different than it does now.
