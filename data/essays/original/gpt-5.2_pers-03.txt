I didn’t get social media because I thought it would change my life or anything. At first it was just a way to keep up with people. In middle school especially, it felt like if you weren’t on Instagram or Snapchat, you were basically invisible. Everyone would be laughing about something from a story, or planning stuff in a group chat, and if you weren’t there you’d find out later and feel kind of left out. So I downloaded the apps and told myself it would just be for “checking in” with friends.

And honestly, sometimes it really does connect me. I like seeing my cousins’ posts because they live in a different state and I don’t get to see them much. My grandma has Facebook and she comments on everything like “Love this!” with a million exclamation points. It’s kind of embarrassing but also sweet, because it means she’s paying attention. When one of my friends moved away last year, social media was how we stayed close. We’d send videos back and forth and keep each other updated on random stuff like a teacher being annoying or a new song we found. In those moments, social media feels like a bridge. It makes the distance smaller.

But then there’s the other side, which I try not to ignore because it’s the part that messes with me. I’ll open TikTok to watch one video and suddenly forty minutes are gone. It’s not even like I’m enjoying it the whole time. It’s more like my brain goes on autopilot and I’m just scrolling because the next thing might be interesting. Sometimes I’ll put my phone down and feel sort of gross and restless, like I ate too much candy. I notice my attention span getting worse too. I’ll start homework and immediately want to check my phone “for a second.” Or I’ll try to watch a movie with my family and I can’t stop thinking about what I’m missing online, which is dumb because it’s usually nothing important.

The jealousy part is what I hate admitting. I know people don’t post their worst moments. Nobody’s posting themselves crying in the bathroom or failing a test. People post the best angle, the best lighting, the highlight reel. I understand that logically. But emotionally, it still gets to me. I’ll see someone’s perfect vacation photos or a group of friends at a party and I’ll suddenly feel like I’m doing life wrong. Like everyone else is constantly having fun and looking amazing and I’m just…not. Even when I know it’s curated, it’s hard not to compare. Sometimes it’s not even about looks. It’s about seeing people hang out without you, or watching someone else get attention, and it makes you question your own place in your friend group.

What’s complicated is that I don’t want to quit completely. When I take breaks, I feel calmer, but I also feel disconnected. It’s like social media is both the party and the noise outside the door. Lately I’ve been trying to set little boundaries, like leaving my phone in another room while I do homework, or turning off notifications for certain apps. I’m not perfect at it, but I’m noticing that I feel more like myself when I’m not constantly watching everyone else.

I think social media isn’t totally good or totally bad, which is annoying because I wish it was simpler. It helps me stay close to people I care about, but it also steals my focus and makes me compare my behind-the-scenes to someone else’s best moments. I’m still figuring out how to use it without letting it use me.
