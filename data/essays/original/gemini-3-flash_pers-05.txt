Last summer was honestly the worst time of my life. My parents finally got their divorce finalized after two years of constant fighting, and it felt like my entire world just kind of collapsed. I felt like I didn't even know who I was anymore because so much of my identity was tied up in being the "peacekeeper" at home. I was exhausted, sad, and just totally numb. So, when my mom suggested we take a trip to Bali just the two of us to "reset," I wasn't really sure it would help, but I knew I needed to get away from my house.

The second we landed in Denpasar, it was like a total sensory overload. The air was so humid it felt like a blanket, and it smelled like incense and tropical flowers. We stayed in this small place in Ubud that was surrounded by rice paddies. For the first few days, I honestly just slept. I think my body was finally realizing it didn't have to be on high alert for an argument anymore.

One morning, we went to the Tirta Empul temple for a purification ritual. I’m not really a religious person, but standing in the cold spring water with a bunch of strangers felt weirdly powerful. As the water hit my head, I kept thinking about all the stress of the last year—the yelling, the moving boxes, the awkward silence at dinner. I realized I had been carrying all that weight around like it was my job to fix it. Letting go of that feeling was the first step in finding myself again.

What really changed things for me, though, was just the pace of life there. In high school, everything is so fast and everyone is always trying to be someone they aren’t. In Bali, people seemed so present. I started spending my afternoons just walking around or sitting in cafes without my phone. I started drawing again, which is something I totally gave up when things got bad at home. I realized that the "authentic" me wasn't the sad kid in the middle of a divorce; I was someone who liked art, spicy food, and being quiet.

I also did a lot of thinking about my parents. I used to think the divorce meant our family was a failure, but being in such a beautiful, peaceful place helped me see it differently. It was just a change. Like the seasons or the tides. I started to feel like I could breathe again without feeling guilty about it.

By the time we had to leave, I didn't feel like a completely different person, but I felt like I had my "spark" back. Healing from trauma isn't like a movie where everything is fixed in one trip, but Bali gave me the space to remember who I was before everything broke. I learned that even when your world falls apart, you can still build something new and maybe even better. I’m back at school now, and things are still hard sometimes, but I try to keep a little bit of that Bali peace with me.
