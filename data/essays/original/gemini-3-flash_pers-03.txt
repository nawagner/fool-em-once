I feel like I spend half my life looking at a screen, and honestly, it’s kind of exhausting. Social media is one of those things where I can’t really imagine my life without it, but sometimes I really wish I could. It’s like this weird love-hate relationship that everyone my age just accepts as normal.

On one hand, it’s how I actually stay in the loop. If I wasn’t on Instagram or TikTok, I feel like I’d literally be a ghost. It’s how my friends and I send each other dumb memes at 11 p.m. to show we’re thinking of each other, and it’s how I see what my cousins in Florida are doing without having to have an awkward twenty-minute phone call. During the pandemic, it was basically a lifeline. It makes the world feel smaller and more connected, which is supposed to be a good thing.

But then there’s the downside, which feels like it’s getting worse the older I get. My attention span is basically nonexistent now. I’ll sit down to do my history homework, tell myself I’m just going to check one notification, and suddenly forty-five minutes have passed. I’ve watched thirty videos of people making pasta or organizing their closets, and I haven't even written the first sentence of my essay. It’s like my brain is rewired to only focus on things that are fifteen seconds long. I try to read a book for English class and I find myself reaching for my phone every two pages just out of habit. It’s actually kind of scary how much control the "scroll" has over me.

The worst part, though, is the "highlight reel" effect. I know, logically, that nobody’s life is perfect. I know people use filters and only post when they’re at a cool party or on vacation. But when I’m sitting in my room in my pajamas feeling bored, and I see someone from school posting these amazing, aesthetic photos at a beach or out with a huge group of friends, I still get that sting of jealousy. It makes me feel like I’m failing at being a teenager. You start comparing your "behind the scenes" to everyone else’s polished front page. It makes everything feel like a competition that I didn't even sign up for.

I’ve tried deleting the apps before, but I usually last about two days. I end up feeling left out of the jokes or I miss a plan someone made in a group chat. It’s like you’re forced to participate if you want a social life, but the price you pay is your focus and your self-esteem. I guess I’m just trying to find a balance, but it’s hard when the apps are literally designed to keep you hooked. For now, I’m just trying to be more aware of it—maybe I’ll put my phone in the other room while I finish this essay. Or at least I’ll try.
