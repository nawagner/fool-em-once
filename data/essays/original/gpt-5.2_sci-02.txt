Earthquakes happen when stress builds up in Earth’s crust and then suddenly releases along a fault. That release sends energy outward as vibrations called seismic waves. Earthquake detectors (usually called seismometers or seismographs) are tools scientists use to measure those vibrations. Even though earthquakes can feel unpredictable, the way we detect and record them is actually based on some pretty simple physics.

The basic idea behind a seismometer is inertia, which is an object’s tendency to stay at rest or keep moving the same way unless something forces it to change. A classic seismometer design has a heavy mass hanging from a spring or sitting on a pivot inside a frame that’s attached to the ground. When the ground shakes, the frame moves with it. But the heavy mass resists that motion and stays almost still for a moment because of inertia. The instrument measures the difference between the moving frame and the “lagging” mass. That difference tells us how much the ground moved and how fast it moved.

Older seismographs used a pen-and-paper setup. The paper drum moved with the ground, and a pen connected to the mass drew a squiggly line. If there was no earthquake, the line stayed mostly flat. During an earthquake, the line jumped around, showing the shaking over time. Modern detectors don’t usually use ink anymore, but they work in a similar way. Many use electromagnetic sensors where a coil and a magnet move relative to each other. That motion creates a tiny electric signal (because moving magnets and coils generate electricity). The signal is then amplified, digitized, and stored on a computer.

Earthquake detectors don’t just say “yes or no” to an earthquake. They can pick up different kinds of seismic waves. The first waves that usually arrive are P-waves (primary waves). They travel fastest and squeeze and stretch the ground, kind of like pushing and pulling a slinky. Next come S-waves (secondary waves), which move the ground side to side or up and down and usually cause more noticeable shaking. After that, surface waves arrive and often cause the most damage near the surface. By looking at the timing and size of these different waves on the seismogram (the recorded signal), scientists can learn about the earthquake’s location and strength.

To figure out where an earthquake happened, scientists use multiple detectors in different places. Each station records when the P-wave and S-wave arrived. Because P-waves travel faster, the gap between the P and S arrival times grows the farther the station is from the earthquake. Using that time gap, each station can estimate its distance to the quake. With at least three stations, scientists can triangulate the epicenter by finding where those distance circles overlap.

Earthquake detectors also help calculate magnitude. Modern magnitude scales (like moment magnitude) are based on the size of the seismic waves and the physics of the fault movement, not just how strong it felt at one spot. Basically, bigger earthquakes produce larger wave amplitudes and longer-lasting signals. Networks of seismometers around the world share data, so scientists can quickly estimate magnitude and issue alerts.

Even though detectors can’t predict earthquakes days in advance, they can support earthquake early warning systems. If sensors close to the epicenter detect the first P-waves, they can send a warning before the stronger S-waves and surface waves reach farther cities. That can give people seconds to tens of seconds to take cover, slow trains, or shut off gas lines. So, earthquake detectors work by measuring ground motion with inertia-based sensors, analyzing wave types and timing, and combining data from many stations to understand what happened and respond faster.
