People call me “chill,” and I guess that’s true. I’m not the type who needs to have every second planned or be doing something “productive” all the time. Honestly, my perfect day is kind of simple, but it’s the kind of simple that makes me feel like my brain finally unclenches. If I could design a day exactly how I want it, it would start slow and stay cozy all the way through.

I’d wake up without an alarm blaring at me like I’m in an emergency situation. The first thing I’d do is make a cup of tea. Not in a fancy way either, just the normal routine: kettle on, mug out, pick a tea bag based on vibes. There’s something calming about the whole process, like it tells my body, “You don’t have to sprint today.” I like sitting there while it steeps, watching the steam rise, and feeling my hands warm up around the mug. It’s such a small thing, but it sets the tone.

Then I’d grab a book and read for a while. I’m not always good at reading when school is busy, because my mind keeps trying to jump ahead to whatever I’m stressed about. But on a perfect day, I can actually sink into the story. I like when the house is quiet and I can hear the pages turning, and I don’t have to check my phone every five minutes. I’m not trying to speed-run the book, either. I just want to be in it for a bit, like a break from real life.

By late morning or early afternoon, I’d meet up with friends for lunch. Nothing too fancy—just a place where we can talk and not feel rushed. I love that part of the day because it’s like the social version of comfort. We’d probably talk about dumb stuff, like a random video we saw, or something that happened in class, or what game we’re all stuck on. There’s something really nice about laughing in public and not caring if we’re a little loud.

After lunch, the ideal plan is co-op video games. I’m not super competitive, so co-op is perfect because it feels like you’re on the same team instead of trying to destroy each other. I like when we’re all working together and it gets chaotic in a funny way. Like someone accidentally presses the wrong button and everything goes wrong, and instead of getting mad we just laugh and try again. It’s honestly one of my favorite ways to hang out, because we’re doing something together but there’s no pressure to be “deep” the whole time.

And then the night part of my perfect day is just watching TV next to my cat. My cat always acts like he doesn’t care about anyone, but the second I sit down, he suddenly needs to be there. He’ll curl up beside me and act like he owns the couch, and I’ll put on some comfort show I’ve already seen. I like that feeling of winding down when nothing is expected of me anymore.

That’s my perfect day: tea, pages, friends, games, and a cat-shaped blanket. It’s not dramatic or exciting, but it feels like me. And honestly, that’s enough.
