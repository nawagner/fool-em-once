So, looking back at it now, my interview for Northwood Prep was probably the most mortifying thirty minutes of my entire life. At the time, I honestly thought my future was over. I had spent weeks practicing "professional" answers in the mirror, wearing a tie that was way too tight, and trying to sound like a forty-year-old businessman instead of a fourteen-year-old who still liked playing video games.

The disaster started about two minutes in. I was so nervous that my hands were shaking, and when the admissions officer, Mr. Henderson, offered me a glass of water, I managed to knock the entire thing over. It didn't just spill; it launched across his desk, soaking his stack of brochures and dripping onto his very expensive-looking rug. I froze. My face felt like it was literally on fire. Instead of saying something cool or collected, I blurts out, "Well, I guess I’m making a splash," and then immediately wanted to crawl into a hole and die.

Mr. Henderson didn't laugh. He just stared at the puddle.

For the next ten minutes, I was a total wreck. I kept forgetting the "perfect" answers I had memorized. When he asked me about my favorite book, I blanked so hard I couldn't even remember the title of *The Great Gatsby*, which I had literally finished the night before. I ended up rambling about a comic book I read in middle school. I felt like a complete fraud. I wasn't the "distinguished scholar" I was trying to be; I was just a clumsy kid who couldn't even hold a cup of water.

But then, something weird happened. Since I figured I had already failed, I stopped trying to be perfect. I took a deep breath and just said, "I’m really sorry. I’m incredibly nervous because I actually really want to go here, and I’m currently doing a terrible job of showing you why."

Mr. Henderson actually smiled for the first time. He told me to relax and asked why I was so stressed. I ended up talking to him—not like an interviewer, but like a person. I told him about how I struggle with being a perfectionist and how I was terrified of making a mistake. We talked about how being "genuine" is actually harder than being "perfect."

I walked out of that room sure I wouldn't get in, but a few weeks later, I got the acceptance letter. Mr. Henderson had actually written a little note on the bottom that said he appreciated my "honesty under pressure."

That whole embarrassing experience taught me that being a "perfect" candidate isn't really the point. If I had just sat there and recited memorized lines, he wouldn't have known who I actually was. Spilling that water was the best thing that could have happened because it forced me to show how I handle a mess—literally. It showed me that growth doesn't come from getting everything right the first time; it comes from being able to laugh at yourself, clean up the water, and keep talking anyway.
